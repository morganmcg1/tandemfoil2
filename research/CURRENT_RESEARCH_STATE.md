# SENPAI Research State
- 2026-04-27 23:42 — round 1 in flight; **first merged baseline established by PR #356**
- Primary metric: `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (equal-weight mean surface pressure MAE across the four val splits); ranking final metric is `test_avg/mae_surf_p`

## Current best (post-PR-#356, baseline of round 1)
- **`val_avg/mae_surf_p` = 132.276** (EMA, ep13/50 timeout-cut)
- **`test_avg/mae_surf_p` = 118.041**
- See `BASELINE.md` for the full per-split breakdown.

## Resolved: scoring NaN bug
- **Root cause** (independently flagged by tanjiro on #356 and askeladd on #351): one sample (`test_geom_camber_cruise` idx 20) has non-finite `y[p]`. `data/scoring.py:accumulate_batch` builds the right per-sample mask but does `err = |pred − y|` *before* the masked sum, so IEEE-754 `NaN*0 = NaN` (and `inf*0 = NaN`) defeats it and poisons the float64 accumulator → `mae_surf_p`/`mae_vol_p` go NaN for the whole split.
- **Fix:** NaN-safe pre-pass in `train.py:evaluate_split` (drops bad-y samples from `mask`, zeros their `y`). Now in baseline. `data/scoring.py` left untouched per program contract.
- **Action item for in-flight PRs:** any returning PR that pre-dates the post-#356 baseline must rebase to pick up the fix; otherwise their `test_avg/mae_surf_p` will be NaN.

## Round 1.5 follow-up assignments (post-#356, all targeting `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2d-r1` baseline)

| PR | Student | Slug | Lever | Why |
|----|---------|------|-------|-----|
| #373 | frieren | mixed-slice-last-layer | Last-layer-only `slice_num=128` (mixed slicing) | Replaces closed #354; pays slice cost only at the regression head — fits in 30-min budget |
| #374 | tanjiro | grad-clip-1p0 | Gradient clipping at `max_norm=1.0` between backward and step | Variance-reduction lever complementary to EMA; pre-clip grad norm logged as diagnostic |

## Round 2 candidates (queued)
Once round 1 finishes (best-of-merged-and-still-WIP) and we have a few merged compounders, the next round will pull from:

- **EMA decay sweep** at fixed budget — try `ema_decay ∈ {0.9999}` (slow) and a warmup-EMA variant (skip first 1–2 epochs of EMA to avoid the random-init drag tanjiro observed at ep1). Polyak-Ruppert bias correction (`/ (1 - decay^t)`) is cheap and tightens early epochs.
- **SwiGLU MLP** at matched param count vs. plain GELU `mlp_ratio=4` — modern transformer recipe; nezuko flagged it.
- **Width × MLP ratio sweep** (`n_hidden ∈ {160, 192}` × `mlp_ratio=4`) once mlp_ratio=4 is confirmed.
- **`surf_weight ∈ {25, 100}`** to bracket the optimum once round 1 establishes whether 50 helps under EMA.
- **Optimizer changes** (Lion, Adan, SOAP).
- **Mesh/sample augmentation** (rotation, sub-sampling for larger effective batch).
- **Physics-informed regularization** (divergence-free / mass conservation auxiliary loss).
- **Multi-scale slice attention** (mix slice_num=32, 64, 128 across layers).
- **Re-engineering of input features** (log-Re bucketing, Fourier position features, distance-to-leading-edge).
- **Per-domain conditioning** (single vs raceCar tandem vs cruise tandem).
- **Throughput levers**: 30-min timeout currently fits ~12–13 epochs of 50; gradient accumulation, smaller batch with memory-light forward, slice subsampling, or torch.compile could buy more epochs in the same wall clock.
- **Train/val mismatch diagnostics**: `val_single_in_dist` is consistently the *worst* split (170.491 at baseline) despite being labelled "in-distribution sanity". Worth investigating — likely the high-Re raceCar single tail.
