# SENPAI Research Results — `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2d-r2`

Round-1 reviews. Primary ranking metric: `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (lower is better). All test_avg/mae_surf_p values in this round are NaN due to a shared scoring/data issue (test_geom_camber_cruise sample 20 has Inf in `y[p]` volume nodes; `data/scoring.py:accumulate_batch` propagates Inf through mask multiplication because IEEE 754 gives `Inf * 0 = NaN`). The bug is real and pre-existing; we will work around it in a round-2 experiment.

## 2026-04-27 23:30 — PR #282: Replace MSE with Huber loss (delta=1.0) in normalized space

- Branch: `charliepai2d2-edward/huber-loss`
- Hypothesis: Huber(δ=1.0) on normalized targets bounds gradient magnitude on high-Re outliers and is closer to the L1 metric than MSE.
- Result: best `val_avg/mae_surf_p = 105.999` at epoch 14 (last epoch before timeout). 14/50 epochs in 30 min budget.
- Per-split val MAE for `p`: single_in_dist=134.05, geom_camber_rc=109.48, geom_camber_cruise=82.72, re_rand=97.75.
- Test (3 finite splits avg): 105.42; full 4-split test_avg = NaN (scoring.py Inf*0 bug, not Huber-related).
- Convergence: train losses monotone (vol 0.59→0.15, surf 0.32→0.08). Val curve descending; one transient spike at epoch 12 recovered by epoch 14. Best epoch was the last epoch — clearly under-trained.
- Metric paths: `models/model-charliepai2d2-edward-huber-loss-20260427-223516/{metrics.jsonl,metrics.yaml}` (also mirrored at `research/student_metrics/`).
- Decision: **MERGE.** This is the round-1 baseline at `val_avg/mae_surf_p = 105.999`. Worth noting the run was cut short — convergence is still likely improving, so the true Huber asymptote is probably better.

## 2026-04-27 23:30 — PR #295: Per-channel surface loss weights [1.0, 1.0, 2.5] for (Ux, Uy, p)

- Branch: `charliepai2d2-tanjiro/pressure-channel-weight`
- Hypothesis: Up-weight `p` (×2.5) inside surface loss to bias gradients toward the headline-metric channel.
- Result: best `val_avg/mae_surf_p = 130.916` at epoch 12. 14/50 epochs in 30 min.
- Per-split val MAE for `p`: single_in_dist=159.60, geom_camber_rc=138.61, geom_camber_cruise=103.86, re_rand=121.59.
- Decision: **CLOSE.** 23% worse than the huber-loss winner from the same round. The intervention behaved as designed (training stable, p MAE descended faster than Ux/Uy in normalized space), but absolute level is dominated by the huber-loss change.
- Direction not dead: revisit channel-weighting on top of the merged huber baseline if other levers plateau. The student's suggestion to also down-weight Ux/Uy (e.g., `[0.5, 0.5, 2.5]`) is a tighter test.

## 2026-04-27 23:30 — PR #297: Pure depth scale: n_layers=8 (no other changes)

- Branch: `charliepai2d2-thorfinn/depth-8`
- Hypothesis: 5→8 layers (matching Transolver paper) tests pure depth as the bottleneck.
- Result: best `val_avg/mae_surf_p = 168.836` at epoch 9. **Only 9/50 epochs** in 30 min budget — depth-8 averages 206 s/epoch.
- Per-split val MAE for `p`: single_in_dist=189.98, geom_camber_rc=230.75, geom_camber_cruise=114.69, re_rand=139.93.
- Decision: **CLOSE** as compute-infeasible at the current 30-min budget. The cosine LR schedule barely engaged (lr ≈ 95% of peak by epoch 9), so the run is grossly under-trained. Hypothesis not falsified, but not testable as designed.
- Follow-up: revisit depth-7 (~10 epochs) or, better, scale capacity in width direction (already covered by alphonse #279 / askeladd #281). Time-budget-aware T_max for cosine is a separate architectural improvement worth considering once results stabilize.

## Test-metric NaN follow-up (cross-PR)

All three reviewed PRs report `test_avg/mae_surf_p = NaN`. Root cause from the student diagnoses:

- One sample (`test_geom_camber_cruise` sample 20) has 761 non-finite values in `y[p]` volume nodes. Surface `p` is finite for that sample.
- `data/scoring.py:accumulate_batch` is *intended* to skip samples with non-finite ground truth (`y_finite` mask), but the implementation computes `err = (pred - y).abs()` over the whole batch *before* masking. With IEEE 754, `Inf * 0 = NaN`, so the masked-out element still poisons the per-channel sum.
- `data/scoring.py` is read-only per `program.md`. The cleanest workaround is in `train.py` `evaluate_split`: filter out samples with any non-finite `y` before calling `accumulate_batch`. We will route this fix through a round-2 PR (charliepai2d2-edward) so paper-facing `test_avg/mae_surf_p` becomes recoverable for all subsequent runs.
