## 2026-04-28 19:30 — PR #782: GeGLU activation on compound base
- Branch: `willowpai2e2-edward/compound-geglu`
- Hypothesis: Replace GELU with GeGLU MLP at mlp_ratio=4 on the compound base (n_layers=3, slice_num=16, n_head=1, n_hidden=128) for richer FFN expressivity.
- W&B run: `v9ruqc0v` (project `senpai-charlie-wilson-willow-e-r2`).

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| best `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 109.8891 (epoch 12 / 20) |
| `test/test_single_in_dist/mae_surf_p` | 110.8508 |
| `test/test_geom_camber_rc/mae_surf_p` | 105.7677 |
| `test/test_geom_camber_cruise/mae_surf_p` | NaN (cruise-split Inf bug) |
| `test/test_re_rand/mae_surf_p` | 102.0296 |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (W&B) | NaN |
| offline-clean test_avg over 3 finite splits | ~106.22 |
| wall clock | 30.1 min (timeout) |

- Outcome: **Send back**. Result is clearly worse than even the default Transolver baseline (~80–82 reference). Critically the experiment is **confounded**: GeGLU's two parallel projections at mlp_ratio=4 mean the FFN has ~3x the params of the GELU mlp_ratio=2 baseline, so we cannot attribute the regression to the activation gate. Asked edward to re-run with mlp_ratio≈8/3 so FFN param count matches the baseline — that gives a clean activation-only A/B.
- Per-batch wall clock at this size (~90s/epoch) means even param-matched the run will stay ≤ 30 min easily.

## 2026-04-28 19:30 — PR #784: OneCycleLR scheduler swap
- Branch: `willowpai2e2-frieren/compound-onecycle`
- Hypothesis: Replace CosineAnnealingLR with OneCycleLR (warmup pct=0.05, div_factor=25, final_div_factor=1e4, per-batch stepping) for better late-epoch fine-tuning. Peak LR unchanged at 5e-4.
- W&B run: `icmk9yw4` (project `senpai-charlie-wilson-willow-e-r2`).

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| best `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 91.7241 (epoch 32 / 50, last completed before timeout) |
| `test/test_single_in_dist/mae_surf_p` | 88.8587 |
| `test/test_geom_camber_rc/mae_surf_p` | 89.7523 |
| `test/test_geom_camber_cruise/mae_surf_p` | NaN (cruise-split Inf bug) |
| `test/test_re_rand/mae_surf_p` | 83.2516 |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (W&B) | NaN |
| offline-clean test_avg over 3 finite splits | 81.62 |
| wall clock | 30.1 min (timeout) |
| LR at timeout | ≈1.6e-4 (vs scheduled floor 5e-8) |

- Outcome: **Send back**. The schedule never completed — only 32/50 epochs (64%) ran, so OneCycleLR's late-stage fine-anneal phase never engaged. Hypothesis is not testable as configured under the 30-min wall clock. Asked frieren to re-run with `--epochs 28` so the full schedule fits within the budget. If it works, we'll have a clean OneCycleLR-vs-cosine A/B once alphonse's anchor (#779) lands.
- Cleanly implemented per-batch step() so the bug story is not the schedule mechanics, only the budget.

## Tooling note (both PRs)
`test_avg/mae_surf_p` is **NaN on every run on this branch** because `test_geom_camber_cruise/000020.pt` contains 761 +Inf values in the `p` channel, and `data/scoring.py::accumulate_batch` does `err * mask` — `Inf * 0 = NaN` in IEEE 754, which then propagates through `.sum()`. PR #797 on the r4 branch added `torch.nan_to_num(pred, ...)` inside `evaluate_split` in `train.py` to guard against this. **Action item: cherry-pick that fix to `icml-appendix-willow-pai2e-r2`** so future PR results have a usable W&B `test_avg/mae_surf_p` without students needing offline re-eval.
