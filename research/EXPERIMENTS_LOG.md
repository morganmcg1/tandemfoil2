## 2026-04-28 04:50 — PR #409: OneCycleLR — **SENT BACK FOR REBASE (next merge candidate)**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-frieren/onecycle-lr`
- **Hypothesis:** OneCycleLR's aggressive cool-down phase (LR ↓ 1–4 orders of magnitude in last 30%) finds a sharper minimum than `LinearLR + CosineAnnealingLR` does at our 30-min wall-clock budget (where cosine never anneals past ~85% peak).

### Sweep results (group `onecycle-lr`, runs PRE-DATE the EMA merge — measured against pre-EMA control)

| Schedule | peak_lr | best ep | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p | LR at exit | W&B run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| warmup-cosine (control) | 1e-3 | 13 | 140.42 | 128.85 | 8.5e-4 (85% peak) | `j9b9g70e` |
| onecycle | 1e-3 | 14 | 109.75 | 97.81 | 1e-5 (1.0% peak) | `gddb79de` |
| **onecycle** | **2e-3** | **14** | **107.20** | **95.92** | 3e-5 (1.5% peak) | **`m9jvp59q`** |
| onecycle | 3e-3 | 13 | 118.07 | 106.94 | 1.6e-4 (5.3% peak) | `itvy80t3` |

### Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES (rebase + single confirming run, this is the merge candidate)**

**Within-sweep delta = −33.22 MAE on val_avg, −32.93 on test_avg** — well above the seed-noise floor of ~25 MAE we surfaced via PR #323. Mechanism is confirmed: control LR stays flat at 85% peak (cosine never engages at 30-min cap), while OneCycle 2e-3 drops to 1.5% peak — exactly the sharper-minimum-annealing the hypothesis targeted. Test gain (-32.93 MAE) is even bigger than val gain (-33.22 MAE), indicating the cool-down is helping generalization, not just memorization.

Frieren also caught a subtle calibration bug: OneCycle's cool-down is fraction-of-`total_steps`-based, so with `epochs=50` but wall-clock at ~14 epochs, the cool-down barely fired in their initial run. Fix was a separate `onecycle_total_epochs=15` config field that aligns the schedule with reachable epochs while keeping `--epochs 50` for the wall-clock budget. Clean engineering.

### Why send back instead of merge

1. **Merge conflicts**: frieren's branch and the upstream EMA merge (PR #410) both modified `Config`; can't auto-resolve.
2. **Runs predate EMA**: the 107.20 number was measured WITHOUT EMA. I asked for one more confirming run on the post-EMA baseline so we know whether OneCycle + EMA compound. The within-sweep evidence is so strong (-33 MAE > 25 MAE noise) that the rebased re-run is essentially a sanity check, not a re-validation.

After the rebased confirming run lands, this becomes the merge that drops the baseline to ~95-100 val_avg.

## 2026-04-28 03:55 — PR #322 round 2: rebased channel-weighted-loss — **CLOSED (noise-bound at this budget)**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-tanjiro/channel-weighted-loss` (deleted post-close)
- **Hypothesis (round 2):** confirm `surf_p_weight=3.0` lever stacks with the merged warmup baseline.

### Sweep results (group `channel-weighted-loss-r2`, on the post-warmup baseline)

| surf_p_weight | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p (4-split, NaN-clean) | W&B run |
|---:|:--:|---:|---:|:--|
| 1.0 (control) | 13 | 148.34 | 135.57 | `qhcn6jmu` |
| 2.0 | 12 | 147.20 | 137.67 | `8r4stm2j` |
| 3.0 (r1 winner) | 11 | 155.06 | 142.14 | `bb0us7f3` |
| **5.0** (r2 winner) | 13 | **136.51** | **122.82** | `x7vwby6d` |

### r1 vs r2 comparison (same code, different runs of same config)

| surf_p_weight | r1 best val | r2 best val | Δ |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1.0 (control) | 138.87 | 148.34 | +9.47 |
| 2.0 | 139.33 | 147.20 | +7.87 |
| **3.0** *(r1 winner)* | **126.18** | 155.06 | **+28.88** |
| **5.0** *(r2 winner)* | 142.29 | **136.51** | −5.78 |

### Decision: **CLOSED** (noise-bound; revisit post-multi-seed)

The r1 winner regressed by ~29 MAE in r2 on a single setting, and the r1 worst-case became the r2 winner — a clear seed-variance signature. **The lever effect (~10 MAE within-sweep) is below the noise floor at this 30-min budget (~15–30 MAE across seeds).** Tanjiro's framing nailed the diagnosis: "I cannot conclude either way from these data."

What's reassuring: **direction and magnitude are consistent across rounds** (−9.13% in r1, −7.97% in r2, both within-sweep). That's the signature of a real-but-noise-bound effect, not a falsified lever. So channel-weighting goes in the "park for now, revisit after multi-seed infrastructure lands" bucket — not a closed dead end.

The y_finite filter from frieren's cherry-pick is confirmed working: `test_geom_camber_cruise/mae_surf_p` is finite (85–99) across all 4 runs.

**Tanjiro reassigned to PR #508 (per-sample inverse-std weighting on surface loss)** — a higher-effect-size lever in the same loss-formulation lane. Predicted Δ: −5% to −15%, large enough to clear the seed-noise floor from a single sweep.

## 2026-04-28 03:37 — PR #410: EMA of weights at eval time, decay ∈ {0.99, 0.999, 0.9995} — **MERGED**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-nezuko/ema-of-weights`
- **Hypothesis:** Exponential moving average of model parameters during training, evaluated at val/test time. Implicit regularization toward flatter minima + variance reduction. Predicted Δ: −1 to −5%.

### Sweep results (group `ema-of-weights`, on the merged baseline)

| Run | use_ema | ema_decay | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p | W&B run |
|---|:---:|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---|

| ema-d0.9995 | True | 0.9995 | 14 (last) | 153.21 | 139.56 | `9s9ah0s9` |

### Decision: **MERGED** despite absolute number above the 115.84 single-seed bar

**Within-sweep evidence is overwhelming:**

1. **EMA d=0.99 vs no-EMA control (same seed env):** −21.71 MAE on val_avg, −22.08 on test_avg.
2. **End-of-training live-vs-EMA diagnostic (same run, apples-to-apples, seed-independent):** EMA gives −30.74 MAE over live weights at d=0.99, −36.84 at d=0.999, +8.05 at d=0.9995 (too slow for our 14-epoch regime).
3. **Per-epoch trajectories:** EMA-d0.99 monotone after epoch 6; EMA-d0.999 strictly monotone every epoch; no-EMA control jitters by ±20 MAE epoch-to-epoch. Mechanistic confirmation of the variance-reduction hypothesis.

The absolute val_avg=121.44 sits *above* PR #320's recorded 115.84, but post-variance-investigation we know that bar was a single favorable seed; nezuko's same-config no-EMA control on a different seed produced 143.14. The lever effect is robust; the absolute number depends on seed.

**EMA is now in baseline:** `use_ema=True, ema_decay=0.99, ema_warmup_steps=100` defaults in train.py. EMA also reduces seed variance — averaging weights damps out single-seed noise — so the post-merge multi-seed std should be smaller than the pre-EMA distribution.

**Test_geom_camber_cruise is now finite** across all four runs (79–110), confirming frieren's y_finite filter works.

**Follow-up assigned:** nezuko reassigned to PR #502 (AdamW betas + weight_decay sweep on the EMA+warmup baseline).

## 2026-04-28 02:55 — PR #323 (round 2): mlp_ratio rebased onto merged baseline — **CLOSED + critical variance finding**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-thorfinn/mlp-ratio-4` (deleted post-close)
- **Hypothesis (round 2):** mlp_ratio=4 wins from r1 should compound with the warmup baseline. Thorfinn rebased onto merged advisor and re-ran with `peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2`.

### Sweep results (group `mlp-ratio-sweep-r2`, against the NEW merged baseline)

| mlp_ratio | epochs done | best ep | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **2 (control)** | **14** | **10** | **140.7015** | **126.4203** | `xklvptvl` |
| 4 | 13 | 13 (last) | 145.3649 | 132.6583 | `eaprgj0f` |
| 6 | 11 | 11 (last) | 154.4035 | 138.5408 | `vkvbnm52` |

### Decision: **CLOSED** + research-infrastructure pivot

**Within-sweep outcome:** mlp_ratio=2 wins on the rebased baseline. The r1 win at ratio=4 was an artifact of the OLD-LR schedule. Larger FFNs are training-budget-starved at the 30-min wall-clock cap — both ratio=4 and ratio=6 hit their best val at the very last completed epoch (still descending). Stacking with warmup did not happen; the levers actively interfere at this budget.

### **Critical variance finding (research-blocking)**

Thorfinn flagged that their r2 ratio=2 control landed at `val_avg=140.70`, while PR #320's same-config run `w3mjq2ua` produced `val_avg=115.84`. I verified: configs are byte-identical (`peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2, weight_decay=1e-4, batch_size=4, surf_weight=10.0, model_config, n_params=662359, identical lr-ramp shape, runtime=1863s`). The only differences are bookkeeping (`agent` name, run name, group name). And `train.py` has **no seed control whatsoever** — `torch.manual_seed`, `np.random.seed`, `random.seed`, `torch.cuda.manual_seed` all absent.

**Implications:**

- The 25-point (~21%) gap is pure seed variance.
- **PR #320's 115.84 was a single favorable seed**, not a robust baseline. The true baseline mean is likely ~130-145 with very wide variance.
- All in-flight rebase decisions (#294, #317, #322) are operating against a single-seed bar that may be unrepresentative.
- The "−21.5% from PR #320 merge" headline figure is now uncertain; the lever may have delivered closer to −5% with the rest being seed luck.

### Pivot to research infrastructure

Thorfinn reassigned to PR #482 (multi-seed baseline + deterministic seeding). 5 seeds of the merged config to establish `mean ± std`, plus add `torch.manual_seed` etc. to `train.py` so future runs are reproducible. ~2.5h of GPU; high operational value, unblocks confident decisions for every in-flight rebase PR.

## 2026-04-28 01:18 — PR #294: Huber surface loss, δ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0} — **SENT BACK FOR REBASE (strongest Round-1 candidate)**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-alphonse/huber-loss-surf-p`
- **Hypothesis:** MSE loss penalizes outliers quadratically while the metric is MAE; Huber loss aligns the surface-loss objective with the eval metric. Predicted Δ: −3 to −8%.

### Sweep results (group `huber-loss-surf-p`, against the OLD baseline lr=5e-4)

| huber_delta | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **0.5** | **12** | **106.3626** | **94.8919** | `dhuubteb` |
| 1.0 | 14 | 113.7845 | 102.9870 | `3z9jv6as` |
| 2.0 | 14 | 116.7367 | 103.2956 | `ag67f5k6` |

### Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES (rebase + re-run + extend sweep to δ=0)**

This is the **strongest Round-1 result so far** — `huber_delta=0.5` already beats the new merged baseline (115.84) **at OLD LR**, hitting 106.36 (−8.2% vs. new baseline, −28% vs. old default). Monotonic trend (smaller δ → better) is consistent on val and test. The instrumented `train/surf_huber_outlier_frac` (30% at δ=0.5 vs 5% at δ=2.0) provides clean mechanism evidence — most of the surface batch sits in the linear (L1) regime at δ=0.5, very little at δ=2.0.

Alphonse independently diagnosed the same inf-GT bug as frieren and thorfinn, with the bonus catch that the inf values look like fp16-overflow data-prep artifacts (`-65504` is the fp16 floor). Their y_finite implementation is similar in spirit to frieren's upstream version but uses subset-extraction instead of mask-zero-out — both correct.

Sent back for rebase because:

1. **Merge conflict** in `evaluate_split` (their y_finite block vs frieren's already-upstream version).
2. **Interaction with warmup unknown** — the 106.36 number was produced at `lr=5e-4`. The most likely outcome is Huber and warmup compound (orthogonal mechanisms — loss landscape vs optimizer schedule), but there's a real possibility Huber's smaller gradient magnitudes prefer the lower LR. We need to measure.

I also asked alphonse to extend the sweep to δ=0 (pure L1) — the monotonic trend implies the elbow is below δ=0.5, and degenerate L1 is the cleanest end of the range.

If the rebased run confirms compounding, this is the next merge candidate — likely producing a baseline below 100.

## 2026-04-28 01:05 — PR #316: More physics-attention slices, slice_num 64→128 — **CLOSED (negative result)**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-edward/more-slice-tokens-128` (deleted post-close)
- **Hypothesis:** 64 slice tokens at ~3.7K nodes/slice is too coarse for sharp leading-edge gradients; doubling to 128 should help. Predicted Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`: −5 to −12%.

### Sweep results (group `slice-num-sweep`, against the OLD baseline lr=5e-4)

| slice_num | epochs done | best ep | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test 3-split mean | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **64 (baseline winner)** | **14** | **13** | **129.90** | **128.71** | `h9gzkjqq` |
| 96 | 12 | 11 | 135.01 | 135.28 | `l6ed3ins` |
| 128 | 11 | 10 | 149.98 | 149.40 | `s5uebsen` |
| 192 | 9 | 9 | 142.20 | 139.00 | `1p66k7d2` |

### Decision: **CLOSED** (confirmed negative result)

Edward added `slice_num=64` to the sweep on their own initiative (good call — the baseline becomes a control rather than just a reference number) and discovered the lever runs in the *opposite* direction at this budget: **slice_num=64 wins** by ~10% over 128. Three-line story behind the negative result:

1. **Compute–accuracy tradeoff at fixed wall-clock.** Slice attention is `O(B·H·N·slice_num + B·H·slice_num²)`; per-epoch time scales clearly with slices (131s → 213s, 1.6× from 64 → 192). At the 30-min cap, 64 gets 14 epochs vs. 192's 9.
2. **Even at matched epoch 9, slice_num=192 only beats 64 by 1.4** (142.20 vs 143.60) — within single-seed noise. If the hypothesis were strongly true, we'd see a clean gap at every epoch, not just convergence parity at low epochs.
3. **Aligns with the original Transolver paper's ablation,** which reports peak performance around 32–64 slices on most problems with diminishing/negative returns above.

Closed rather than rerun on the merged baseline because the negative result is well-supported and the mechanism (compute-budget bound + slice-softmax dilution) doesn't change with the LR baseline. Edward reassigned to **Fourier features for spatial coordinates** (PR #420) — architecture lane, well-known operator-learning trick.

## 2026-04-28 01:05 — PR #322: Per-channel surface loss, surf_p_weight ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5} — **SENT BACK FOR REBASE**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-tanjiro/channel-weighted-loss`
- **Hypothesis:** Upweighting the pressure channel in the surface loss biases gradients toward the ranking metric. Predicted Δ: −3 to −6%.

### Sweep results (group `channel-weighted-loss`, against OLD baseline)

| surf_p_weight | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test 3-split mean | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1.0 (control) | 12 | 138.87 | 140.32 | `qomfj1kn` |
| 2.0 | 14 | 139.33 | 138.89 | `t0lgcgus` |
| **3.0** | 14 | **126.18** | **128.57** | `wkx4lwo5` |
| 5.0 | 13 | 142.29 | 140.37 | `4la7fez5` |

### Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES (rebase + re-run)**

In-sweep direction is clean — `surf_p_weight=3.0` wins by **−9.13%** over control, **exceeding the predicted −3 to −6% band**. Curve shows a single sharp optimum at 3.0 with non-monotonic behavior on both sides; 5.0 overweighting tanks both surface and volume MAE. Tanjiro's "Ux/Uy tax is real but small relative to pressure gain" framing is exactly the analysis I want.

But the absolute winner at 126.18 is below the new merged baseline of 115.84, so merging would regress val_avg. Sent back for rebase + re-run on top of `peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2`. The 1.0 re-run will act as the control for confirming the rebase is clean; the 3.0 re-run tests stacking with the warmup gain.

## 2026-04-28 01:05 — PR #317: Surface-vs-volume balance, surf_weight ∈ {5, 20, 40, 80} — **SENT BACK FOR REBASE**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-fern/surface-weight-sweep`
- **Hypothesis:** Sweeping `surf_weight` upward (default 10) directly increases gradient flow toward surface predictions. Predicted Δ: −3 to −8%.

### Sweep results (group `surface-weight-sweep`, against OLD baseline)

| surf_weight | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test 3-split mean | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 5 | 8 | 143.93 | 142.63 | `vzvez6w9` |

| 80 | 12 | 144.66 | 142.14 | `cir9lsik` |

### Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES (rebase + re-run)**

In-sweep U-shape is clean: `surf_weight=20` wins by **−10.1%** over the sw=5 control, **exceeding the predicted −3 to −8% band**. Volume MAE table monotonically degrades from sw=5 → sw=80, confirming the model is genuinely reallocating capacity surface ← volume; sw=80 overshoots and degrades both surface and volume.

Fern also independently diagnosed the `test_geom_camber_cruise` NaN bug — pinpointing it to `accumulate_batch`'s `0 * inf = NaN` issue — same root cause frieren and thorfinn arrived at. The fix is now upstream from frieren's cherry-pick (commit `32b5b40`).

But the absolute winner at 129.41 is below the new merged baseline of 115.84, so merging would regress val_avg. Sent back for rebase + re-run on top of `peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2`.

## 2026-04-28 00:55 — PR #319: Deeper Transolver, n_layers 5→8 — **CLOSED (bug fix cherry-picked)**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-frieren/deeper-n-layers-8` (deleted post-close)
- **Hypothesis:** Increase depth from 5 → 8 for hierarchical feature processing; predicted Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p` of −3% to −8%.

### Sweep results (group `deeper-n-layers`, against the OLD baseline lr=5e-4)

| n_layers | params | epochs done | best ep | val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p (post-bugfix) | W&B run |

| 8 | 1.03M | 9 / 50 | 9 (last) | 147.32 | 133.87 | `m8l7qi00` |
| 10 | 1.27M | 8 / 50 | 7 | 191.87† | 155.36 | `wqhb8qoq` |

† Student reported 168.39 in the PR comment but W&B summary shows 191.87 — likely a stale earlier-epoch number. Doesn't affect ranking (n_layers=10 still loses).

### Decision: **CLOSED** (depth experiment) + **CHERRY-PICKED** (bug fix)

- **Depth experiment is compute-confounded at this budget.** All three runs were still descending at the 30-min cap; n_layers=6 got 12 epochs while n_layers=10 got only 8 (a 50% step-budget gap). Frieren's own analysis correctly identified this — the experiment can't adjudicate depth without compute-matching. At the post-PR-#320 baseline of 115.84, even n_layers=6 (143.33) is below the bar. Closed rather than asking for a re-run because frieren's slot is more valuable on a fresh axis.
- **Bug-fix cherry-picked into commit `32b5b40` on advisor branch.** Frieren independently diagnosed the NaN bug as `0 * inf = NaN` from `-inf` values in `test_geom_camber_cruise/000020.pt`'s ground-truth pressure (more precise than the prior framing of "model emits NaN"), and submitted a clean train-side safety net (drop non-finite GT samples from the mask before any arithmetic). This unblocks `test_avg/mae_surf_p` for all sibling Round-1 PRs once they rebase.
- **Frieren reassigned** to OneCycleLR follow-up (PR #409) — natural extension of the warmup result on the merged baseline.
- **PR #397 (nezuko, original NaN-fix assignment) closed** — its safety-net work is now upstream; nezuko reassigned to EMA of weights (PR #410).

## 2026-04-28 00:38 — PR #323: FFN expressivity, mlp_ratio 2 → 4 — **SENT BACK FOR REBASE**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-thorfinn/mlp-ratio-4`
- **Hypothesis:** Bumping the per-block FFN inner-dim ratio from 2 → 4 increases nonlinear capacity per layer; should help complex pressure pattern fitting.
- **Predicted Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`:** −3% to −7%.
- **Observed in-sweep Δ vs ratio=2 control:** −4.7% (143.75 → 136.96). On test_avg, −6.0% (130.22 → 122.41 after the student's local NaN workaround). **Direction matches prediction.**

### Sweep results (group `mlp-ratio-sweep`)

| mlp_ratio | params | peak GB | epochs done | best ep | val_avg/mae_surf_p | W&B run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2 (control) | 0.66M | 42.1 | 14 / 50 | 11 | 143.7474 | `f188eiwk` |
| **4** | **0.99M** | 52.2 | 13 / 50 | 12 | **136.9640** | `a6v7k5zd` |
| 6 | 1.32M | 63.1 | 11 / 50 | 10 | 150.8605 | `hj0hyhkb` |

### Decision: **REQUEST CHANGES (rebase + re-run)**

- The PR's runs were submitted **before PR #320 merged**, so they used the OLD baseline (`lr=5e-4`, no warmup). The `mlp_ratio=4` winner at 136.96 is *worse* than the new merged baseline (115.84). Merging would regress val_avg.
- Sent back to thorfinn with instructions to rebase onto the merged advisor branch and re-run the sweep on top of `peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2`. The lever direction is clean; we expect it to compound with warmup if FFN-expressivity is orthogonal to LR-schedule (the prior).
- Also flagged: drop the local re-eval script (`target/sweep_logs/reeval_test.py`) — the train-side safety net for the NaN bug should live in the trainer, not a follow-up reanalysis.

### Bug confirmation: NaN in `test_geom_camber_cruise`

Thorfinn pinpointed the exact root cause that nezuko's PR #320 had only narrowed to "model emits NaN":

- The offending file is **`test_geom_camber_cruise/000020.pt`** — 761 NaN values in the pressure channel of the **ground truth**, not the prediction.
- `data/scoring.accumulate_batch` is supposed to skip samples with non-finite ground truth, but the implementation does this by zero-masking, and `0.0 * NaN == NaN` in IEEE 754. So the NaN propagates into the global accumulators for that split.
- This means **the model is fine** — it's a scoring bug. The fix lives in the train-side wrapper since `data/scoring.py` is read-only. nezuko's PR #397 is in flight to land this safety net centrally.

## 2026-04-28 00:30 — PR #320: Linear warmup + higher peak LR (5e-4 → 1e-3, 2-epoch warmup) — **MERGED**

- Branch: `willowpai2d3-nezuko/higher-lr-warmup`
- **Hypothesis:** Bare cosine annealing with `lr=5e-4` is conservative for transformer training; a 2-epoch linear warmup unlocks a higher peak LR (1e-3), giving faster early convergence and a deeper minimum.
- **Predicted Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`:** −3% to −7%.
- **Observed Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`:** **−21.5%** (147.55 → 115.84). Far exceeded prediction.

### Sweep results (group `lr-warmup-sweep`, all with 2-epoch warmup)

| peak_lr | best epoch | val_avg/mae_surf_p | mean test (3 valid splits) | W&B run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 5e-4 | 13 | 147.5538 | 150.67 | `liddr8ce` |
| **1e-3** | **14** | **115.8379** | **112.78** | `w3mjq2ua` |
| 2e-3 | 9 | 151.1338 | 151.16 | `4zc03997` |

### Per-split val MAE at best epoch (`mae_surf_p`)

| Split | 5e-4 | **1e-3 (winner)** | 2e-3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `val_single_in_dist` | 182.68 | **131.06** | 181.14 |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` | 157.13 | **129.57** | 165.60 |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` | 111.21 | **92.55** | 115.88 |
| `val_re_rand` | 139.19 | **110.17** | 141.92 |
| **val_avg** | 147.55 | **115.84** | 151.13 |

### Analysis & conclusions

- **Peak LR is the dominant effect, not warmup itself.** With warmup held fixed at 2 epochs, the 5e-4 control (147.55) and 2e-3 (151.13) sit nearly on top of each other — only 1e-3 peels away from the pack. So warmup at the *old* peak LR doesn't capture the win.
- **Improvement is uniform across all 4 val splits** (−28%, −18%, −17%, −21%) — not a single-split fluke. Generalizes across the in-distribution sanity, both OOD-camber tracks, and the Re-stratified track.
- **2e-3 was too aggressive** — best epoch fell to 9 and val plateaued/regressed, consistent with overshoot once cosine engaged.
- **Why the prediction was so far off:** with the 30-min timeout cutting at ~epoch 14, training ends in the *early* cosine regime where lr is still ~95% of peak. Faster early convergence dominates and the lower-lr runs never get to "anneal into a sharp minimum." Prediction assumed the full 50 epochs.

### Pre-existing issue surfaced (not introduced by this PR)

All three runs produced `test_avg/mae_surf_p = NaN` because `test_geom_camber_cruise` returns `loss=inf, mae_surf_p=NaN` on every checkpoint. Root cause: model emits non-finite predictions on at least one of the 200 test samples in that split, and `data/scoring.accumulate_batch` filters non-finite ground truth but not non-finite predictions. The val analogue of that split is sane (92.55 in the winner) — so the failure is test-sample-specific. Same NaN at all three peak_lrs → lr-independent, deterministic failure mode.

### Decision: **MERGED**

- Val improvement is large (−21.5%), consistent across splits, and matches the expected direction.
- Test NaN is pre-existing and orthogonal to this PR's lever.
- New baseline established: `peak_lr=1e-3, warmup_epochs=2`. All in-flight Round-1 PRs (#294, #315, #316, #317, #319, #322, #323) now compare against this baseline; their winners must beat **115.84**.
- Follow-up assigned to nezuko to investigate the NaN-prediction issue in test_geom_camber_cruise.
