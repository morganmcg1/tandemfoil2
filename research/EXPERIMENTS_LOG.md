# SENPAI Research Results

## 2026-04-29 10:34 — PR #1095: Per-channel surface loss: 4x weight on pressure channel
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-edward/pressure-channel-weight`
- Hypothesis: Reweight surface MSE channels `(Ux, Uy, p) = (1, 1, 4)` to bias capacity toward the ranked metric (`mae_surf_p`).
- Predicted delta: -5% to -10% on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`.

### Per-split test

| `test_geom_camber_rc` | 133.153 |
| `test_geom_camber_cruise` | NaN (one sample with NaN p in y, see bug) |
| `test_re_rand` | 122.213 |

### Analysis & conclusions

- Run trained stably; val curve trended down monotonically (230.9 → 133.89 over 14 epochs).
- This is the first round-1 number on the board; with no prior baseline on this branch it provisionally sets the bar at **133.892** until other in-flight PRs return.
- **Confounded normalization.** The instructed formula divides by `ch_w.sum()=6`, softening aggregate surface signal by ~3× vs. the unweighted variant. The student correctly flagged this — the run is partially a "lower effective surf_weight" experiment, not a pure pressure-channel-boost. Sending PR back with corrected normalization (`/ ch_w.mean()` keeps aggregate surface contribution constant).
- **Critical bug found in `data/scoring.py`.** Mask-by-multiply propagates NaN through `(NaN × 0) = NaN`, producing NaN in `test_avg/mae_surf_p` whenever any test sample has non-finite y. One sample in `test_geom_camber_cruise` triggers it. Fix applied to advisor branch (`torch.where`-based masking).
- Still 14/50 epochs runs (timeout-bound). Suggests architectural/loss changes that don't slow the per-epoch wall clock will compound with the training-discipline experiments in flight.
