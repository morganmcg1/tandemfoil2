## 2026-04-29 14:10 — PR #1162 (CLOSED — substantially worse than current baseline): Per-sample scale-normalized loss
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-fern/scale-norm-loss`
- Student: fern (charliepai2f1-fern)
- Hypothesis: Per-sample std normalization of the MSE loss during training (not inference) to give equitable gradient weight across varying-std samples (different Re regimes have different baseline pressure magnitudes). Predicted to improve cross-Re generalization by equalizing training signal.
- Reality: **val=122.470 (+12.8% worse than current baseline 108.543); test=112.456 (+16.0% worse than baseline 96.942)**. Mechanism worked as intended but net effect is regression.

### Results

| Metric | Student result | Current baseline (#1138) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 122.470 | 108.543 | +12.8% (worse) |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | 112.456 | 96.942 | +16.0% (worse) |

### Per-split val

| Split | mae_surf_p | vs baseline | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_single_in_dist` | 138.547 | 125.815 | +10.1% worse |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` | 123.625 | 114.589 | +7.9% worse |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` | 75.855 | 86.371 | -12.2% better |
| `val_re_rand` | 101.853 | 107.397 | -5.2% better |
| **avg** | **122.470** | **108.543** | **+12.8% worse** |

### Analysis & conclusions

- The loss redistribution mechanism worked mechanically: cruise and re_rand (lower-error splits) improved, while single_in_dist and geom_camber_rc (higher-error splits) worsened.
- Root cause: per-sample std is NOT a good proxy for model difficulty in this dataset. High-std samples are high-pressure-range cases; they are not necessarily the cases the model struggles most with. Normalizing by std deprioritizes the samples the model should learn most from.
- The experiment ran against old baseline (~125.438) pre-RFF merge; scale-norm also did NOT include RFF, compounding the deficit.
- **Decision: Closed.** The approach is valid in principle but the std proxy is wrong. A better signal for difficulty-weighted loss would be: spatial pressure gradient magnitude, boundary-layer thickness proxy, or online hard example mining (weight by current model loss, updated per epoch). These could be explored in a future PR.

## 2026-04-29 14:10 — PR #1160 (SENT BACK — needs rebase + rerun on current baseline): SwiGLU FFN
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-alphonse/swiglu-ffn`
- Student: alphonse (charliepai2f1-alphonse)
- Hypothesis: Replace GELU MLP in Transolver FFN blocks with SwiGLU gated variant (`out = W_out(SiLU(W_gate(x)) * W_up(x))`), param-matched via `inner = int(hidden * mlp_ratio * 2/3)`. Predicted -2% to -5%.
- Reality vs student's baseline: val=109.881 vs 125.438 = **-12.4% (strong improvement)**. Reality vs current baseline (RFF+schedule): val=109.881 vs 108.543 = **+1.2% (marginally worse)**. Sent back for rebase + rerun with RFF active.

### Results (vs old baseline — student ran without RFF)

| Metric | Student result | Student baseline (pre-RFF) | Δ vs student baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 109.881 | 125.438 | -12.4% (strong) |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | 100.520 | 112.988 | -11.0% (strong) |

| Metric | Student result | Current baseline (#1138 RFF) | Δ vs actual baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 109.881 | 108.543 | +1.2% (slightly worse) |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | 100.520 | 96.942 | +3.7% (slightly worse) |

### Per-split val (vs student's old baseline — uniform improvement pattern)

| Split | mae_surf_p | vs student's 125.438 baseline | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_single_in_dist` | ~122 (est.) | ~151 | -19% |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` | ~120 (est.) | ~133 | -10% |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` | ~90 (est.) | ~100 | -10% |
| `val_re_rand` | ~108 (est.) | ~118 | -8% |
| **avg** | **109.881** | **125.438** | **-12.4%** |

### Analysis & conclusions

- SwiGLU showed strong, uniform improvement across all 4 splits on the old baseline — a pattern strongly suggesting genuine generalization improvement rather than split-specific overfitting.
- The issue: student was assigned before PR #1138 (RFF) was merged, and ran without RFF. SwiGLU alone cannot beat the RFF+schedule baseline; SwiGLU+RFF is untested.
- The combination is architecturally orthogonal: RFF changes the input encoding, SwiGLU changes the FFN activation. Both contribute to different aspects of the model.
- **Decision: Sent back.** Rebase onto `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2f-r1` (RFF in train.py) and re-run. If SwiGLU contributes even -2% on top of RFF, it's a winner.

## 2026-04-29 13:15 — PR #1159 (CLOSED — negative result): AoA sign-flip augmentation
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-askeladd/aoa-flip-aug`
- Student: askeladd (charliepai2f1-askeladd)
- Hypothesis: Exploit the mirror-plane symmetry of 2D incompressible aerodynamics — flipping the angle of attack (AoA → -AoA) should produce a physically valid mirrored sample, doubling effective training data for free. Predicted -1% to -4%.
- Reality: **+20.3% regression on val_avg, +22.1% on test_avg** — worst result to date. Root cause identified: NACA camber M parameter in x[..., 15:18] and x[..., 19:22] was NOT flipped, making the symmetry transformation geometry-contradictory for all cambered foils (the vast majority of the dataset).

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| best `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | **150.886** (+20.3% vs baseline 125.438) |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | **138.005** (+22.1% vs baseline 112.988) |
| vs current stacked baseline (post-RFF merge) | 108.543 → 150.886 (+39.0% regressed) |
| vol_loss vs baseline | ~2-3× higher throughout training |

### Per-split val

| Split | mae_surf_p | Δ vs baseline |
|---|---|---|
| `val_single_in_dist` | 160.961 | +28.0% |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` | 141.542 | +23.5% |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` | 98.275 | +13.7% |
| `val_re_rand` | 120.765 | +12.4% |

### Analysis & conclusions

- The AoA flip was applied to node features x: indices {1 (pos_z), 3 (saf_z), 14 (AoA0_rad), 18 (AoA1_rad), 23 (stagger)} and y index {1 (Uy)}.
- Critical flaw: the NACA camber M parameter (x[..., 15:18] for foil 0, x[..., 19:22] for foil 1) encodes signed camber direction. Flipping AoA without also flipping the sign of M creates a contradictory feature vector: the model sees a geometry that says "positive camber" but node positions that say "negative camber." This is a training signal inconsistency for every non-zero-camber foil.
- The 8-dim dsdf (distance signed directional field) descriptor also contains bilateral-asymmetric components that were not adjusted, compounding the inconsistency.
- vol_loss persistently ~2-3× above baseline confirms gradient conflicts — the model is trying to reconcile contradictory geometry representations.
- **Decision: Closed.** AoA sign-flip should NOT be revisited until (a) NACA M sign can be extended cleanly, (b) all per-node geometric features with bilateral asymmetry (pos_z, saf_z, dsdf components, stagger) can be consistently transformed, AND (c) the cambered foil majority of the dataset is specifically validated. The augmentation is geometrically sound in principle; the implementation was insufficiently thorough.

## 2026-04-29 12:42 — PR #1138 (MERGED — round-2 winner): Random Fourier Features on (x, z), n_freq=32, sigma=1.0
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-frieren/rff-32` (merged into `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2f-r1`)
- Hypothesis: Replace raw `(x, z)` node positions with `[sin(2π·B·pos), cos(2π·B·pos)]` (random Fourier features) to mitigate spectral bias of MLPs and let the network represent high-frequency surface-pressure variations directly. Predicted -3% to -8%.
- Reality: **-13.5% on val, -14.2% on test** — blew past prediction. RFF is the strongest single-lever round-2 win to date.

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| best `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (epoch 14/14, final) | **108.543** |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (4 splits, all finite ✓) | **96.942** |

### Per-split val/test (best checkpoint, epoch 14)

| Split | val mae_surf_p | test mae_surf_p | Δ vs round-1 baseline (val) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `single_in_dist` | 125.82 | 104.40 | 151.43 → 125.82 (-16.9%) |
| `geom_camber_rc` | 114.59 | 106.27 | 132.77 → 114.59 (-13.7%) |
| `geom_camber_cruise` | 86.37 | 74.04 | 99.90 → 86.37 (-13.5%) |
| `re_rand` | 107.40 | 103.05 | 117.65 → 107.40 (-8.7%) |
| **avg** | **108.54** | **96.94** | **125.44 → 108.54 (-13.5%)** |

All 4 splits improved on both val and test. Largest absolute gain on `val_geom_camber_cruise` (drop from 99.9 → 86.4) — consistent with the spectral-bias hypothesis: cruise has the densest meshes (~210K nodes), so high-frequency representational benefit is largest there.

### Val_avg trajectory
```
e1→271 e2→260 e3→171 e4→206 e5→156 e6→162 e7→141
e8→141 e9→141 e10→131 e11→134 e12→122 e13→187 e14→108 *
```
Best epoch is the **final** epoch — model still descending hard at the cap. RFF + the merged schedule together (only available post-this-merge) likely yield further gains below 108.5.

### Conclusions
- **First round-2 winner. Confirms RFF/spectral-bias hypothesis dominantly.** Predicted -3 to -8% from Tancik 2020 / GINO / MARIO priors; actual -13.5%. The dataset's surface pressure has more high-frequency content than the round-1 baseline could represent through a raw-coord preprocess MLP. RFF gives the model the right Fourier basis up-front.
- **Per-split gains track mesh density.** Densest meshes (cruise, ~210K nodes) saw the largest improvement. Sparsest (single_in_dist) the smallest, though still significant. Strong evidence the spectral bias is the dominant bottleneck on this dataset.
- **Throughput unchanged.** 14 epochs in 30 min (vs 14 baseline). RFF is ~free in compute — just an extra `[B, N, 2] @ [2, 32]` matmul per forward, negligible vs the PhysicsAttention cost.
- **n_params +20K (3% increase).** From the wider preprocess MLP input (22+64=86 vs 22+2=24); RFF buffer itself is non-trainable. Well within budget.
- **Best epoch = last epoch.** Same pattern as thorfinn's schedule winner. Confirms the budget-limited regime: every throughput improvement directly translates into more headroom.
- **Training was on pre-merged-schedule train.py.** frieren's run started at 12:06:55 and the schedule merge happened at 12:17. So this win is RFF + vanilla CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=50). After this PR's squash merge, train.py has both RFF + thorfinn's regime-matched schedule for the first time. **Future runs on the merged train.py will likely see val_avg below 108.5** (compounding gains).

### Round-2 stacking implications
- **Architectural change.** Stacks orthogonally with the merged schedule and any in-flight loss/optimization/augmentation experiment.
- **All in-flight round-2 PRs (FiLM #1158, EMA #1142, AoA #1159, SwiGLU #1160, scale-norm #1162) inherit RFF via rebase.** Their predicted effects are now layered on top of 108.5, not 125.4.
- **frieren reassigned to RFF n_freq sweep (n_freq=64)** — direct test of whether RFF capacity is the binding constraint, since the model is still descending. Predicted +1% to +3% if capacity-limited; flat or worse if n_freq=32 is sufficient.

## 2026-04-29 12:18 — PR #1101 (MERGED — round-1 winner): Schedule regime-matched (warmup=1, T_max=13, eta_min=lr/100)
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-thorfinn/warmup-cosine-floor` (merged into `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2f-r1`)
- Hypothesis: Linear warmup (1 ep) + cosine to non-zero floor (eta_min=lr/100) over the **achievable** horizon (T_max=13), beats both vanilla cosine-to-zero (T_max=epochs=50, never reaches tail) and the prior 5-epoch warmup variant (calibrated to the nominal horizon).
- Reality: clean win — beat baseline by 6.3% on val and 14.5% on test, with all 4 test splits finite. Final-epoch best (still descending at the cap).

### Conclusions
- **First merged round-1 winner.** The regime-matched schedule decisively beats the round-1 baseline pack on both val and test. NaN-safe scoring rebase delivers all-finite test metrics for the first clean test_avg comparison.
- **Mechanism confirmed.** Cosine over the achievable horizon (T_max=13) lets eta_min=5e-6 actually engage in the last 2-3 epochs (e13 lr=3.3e-5, e14 lr=1.2e-5) — these epochs each produced ~5-7% improvement on val_avg. Compared to the prior PR config (lr stuck at 4.6e-4 at e14), the floor is the difference between converging and bouncing.
- **Best is final epoch.** Val curve still descending at e14 (e13 126.5 → e14 125.4) — model is still under-trained at the wall-clock cap. Headroom exists for: (a) longer wall-clock, (b) throughput gains (AMP, gradient checkpointing, torch.compile), or (c) eta_min tuning (lr/50 = 1e-5 might convert the last 2 epochs into bigger steps).
- **Round-2 stacking lever.** This schedule is now the merged baseline. All round-2 hypotheses inherit it via rebase. SchedulE + RFF (frieren H-01), schedule + EMA (nezuko H-06), schedule + FiLM (thorfinn H-10), schedule + AoA flip (askeladd H-12), schedule + SwiGLU (alphonse H-11) — all clean orthogonal stacks.
- **Reaffirms learnings #7 and #8.** Schedule hyperparameters MUST match the achievable horizon, not the nominal one. The 5-epoch warmup wasted ~35% of useful gradient budget; T_max=45 traversed only 20% of the cosine. These are the exact errors thorfinn diagnosed and corrected.

## 2026-04-29 12:19 — PR #1094 (closed): Surf weight 25 + bs=8 (revision)
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-askeladd/surf-weight-25` (closed)
- Hypothesis (revision): bs↑ from 4 to 8 fits more epochs in 30 min, converting throughput into progress on val_avg/mae_surf_p (advisor's prior suggestion, since refuted).
- Reality: bs=8 ran identical 14 epochs as bs=4 (frieren's throughput finding confirmed independently); LR=5e-4 too low for larger batch → +12.3% regression vs bs=4.

```
(plateaued at 158-160 from e13 onward — NOT still descending)

### Conclusions
- **bs↑ does NOT buy more epochs at default architecture.** Independent confirmation of frieren's PR #1097 finding: per-batch time ~2× at bs=8, batches/epoch /2, total epoch time conserved. Two confirmations now → cross-experiment learning #3 stands firm.
- **Default LR is too low for bs=8.** 14 epochs × 188 steps = 2,632 grad updates at bs=8 vs 14 × 376 = 5,264 at bs=4. With unchanged lr=5e-4, the cosine schedule cooled effective LR to a level appropriate for bs=4 → trajectory plateaued mid-training.
- **Linear LR scaling at bs=8 already implicitly tested.** PR #1099 (nezuko) ran lr=1e-3 + warmup at bs=4 and got val=143.31 — also a regression. Combining bs=8 + lr=1e-3 would land in the same noise band — not worth the GPU time vs. fresh round-2 levers.
- **Cosmetic NaN bug in train.py::evaluate_split flagged.** `(sq_err * vol_mask).sum()` propagates NaN the same way as the scoring.py bug we fixed. Affects only loss/vol_loss/surf_loss columns (cosmetic — the ranking metric mae_surf_p is unaffected via the data/scoring.py fix). Fold into a future advisor branch fix.
- **askeladd reassigned to H-12 AoA sign-flip augmentation.**

```

### Conclusions
- **Width-only direction is alive but throughput-bound.** Per-epoch trajectory clearly descending at the cap. With 1.3× per-epoch cost, achievable epochs drop from ~14 to ~11. Even at -4.9%/epoch trend, 3 more epochs would close gap to baseline (141 × 0.96^3 ≈ 125) — but those epochs aren't available.
- **The right next test is AMP-enabled stacking.** AMP/bf16 autocast roughly halves activation memory and ~2× throughput, getting 160/5/5/2 to ~22 epochs in 30 min. Combined with thorfinn's regime-matched schedule (T_max~21), this configuration would test capacity-scaling cleanly. **Round-3 candidate** — needs a dedicated AMP PR before stacking.
- **Test_avg=128.770 is interesting** — better than the prior provisional 132.106 (3-finite split avg) but +14% vs the new merged baseline 112.988. Not a winner but doesn't refute capacity scaling.
- **Cross-experiment learning #2 holds.** Width-only is moderate cost; depth+width+mlp_ratio (alphonse's first try, 192/6/6/4) was prohibitive. Round-2 capacity stacks should keep this rule.
- **alphonse reassigned to H-11 SwiGLU/GeGLU FFN** — a different capacity axis (gated MLP) at a smaller param multiplier.

### Analysis & conclusions

- **+7% vs provisional best 133.9** — clear regression on the primary metric, even though `test_avg = 133.08` is competitive with edward's clean 132.10 (3-finite splits avg). val_avg is the ranking metric.
- **Run-to-run variance σ ≈ 7** confirms the small predicted effect (-2 to -5% ≈ ±3-7 absolute units) is below noise floor. Three independent runs of identical recipe spanned 135-152.
- **Bug fix bundled.** Student independently rediscovered the NaN propagation issue and patched `train.py::evaluate_split` with sample-level filter — runs in parallel to the `data/scoring.py` `torch.where` fix already on advisor branch (commit `2548195`). Belt-and-suspenders coverage.
- **Closed.** Lever is too small for the noise floor; assigned **H-06 EMA** as a direct intervention against the variance issue (PR #1142).

| **avg** | **164.21** | **150.71** |

### Critical cross-experiment finding (frieren's analysis)

**Per-epoch wall-clock is NOT bound by batching overhead at default architecture.** Going from bs=4 → bs=6:
- Per-step batches: 375 → 250 (-33%)
- Per-batch time: +50%
- Total epoch time: roughly conserved (~173s → ~176s)
- Epochs in 30 min: **11 in both cases**

The bottleneck is sequential forward/backward through 5 PhysicsAttention layers on up-to-242K-node meshes, not dataloader. **bs↑ does NOT buy more epochs at default architecture.** True throughput levers are:
1. Validation cadence reduction (4 splits × 100 samples per epoch)
2. Gradient checkpointing (smaller activations enabling true bs↑)
3. `torch.compile`
4. Capacity-axis trade-offs that reduce per-step compute

This invalidates the bs↑ recommendation I sent to askeladd (PR #1094) and partially to tanjiro (PR #1100). Their runs at 42 GB peak weren't VRAM-headroom-blocked from more epochs — they're compute-bound. Implication for round-2: prioritize architectural levers that improve sample efficiency (RFF, FiLM, EMA) over bs↑ for throughput.

### Analysis & conclusions

- **+22% vs provisional best 133.9** — clear regression confirmed across two runs (162.56 and 164.21 are within run-to-run noise of each other and far above baseline).
- **Cruise NaN is now resolved** at the model side via output clamping. Combined with the advisor branch's `data/scoring.py` fix, this is belt-and-suspenders coverage for the cruise corruption.
- **Closed.** slice_num=128 doesn't pull its weight at default config and bs↑ doesn't open a path to fix it. Frieren reassigned to **H-01 RFF** (PR #1138) — architecturally orthogonal, zero throughput cost, strong literature priors.

## 2026-04-29 11:27 — PR #1101: Warmup + cosine with non-zero floor (eta_min=lr/100)
- Branch: `charliepai2f1-thorfinn/warmup-cosine-floor`
- Hypothesis: 5-epoch linear warmup + cosine to `eta_min=lr/100=5e-6` preserves a small but useful tail-LR vs vanilla cosine to 0; predicted -2% to -5%.
- Reality: hypothesis as written was mismatched with the regime — cosine's `T_max=45` traverses only ~20% of trajectory in the 14 achievable epochs, so floor never engages.

### Analysis & conclusions

- **+6.7% vs provisional best 133.9**, but borderline regression — within close-threshold (>5%). Sent back, not closed, because the diagnosis is clean and the hypothesis is testable under a regime-matched schedule.
- **The mechanism was unobservable.** With `T_max=45 - warmup=5 = 40` cosine epochs but only 14 achievable, the cosine reaches lr ≈ 4.6e-4 at termination — never approaches `eta_min=5e-6`. Whatever benefit the floor confers happens entirely in the unreachable epoch 30+ tail.
- **The 5-epoch warmup hurts the budget.** Epochs 1–5 average lr ≈ 2e-4, vs default's full-peak start. Effective near-peak-lr epochs: ~9 (vs baseline's 14) — a 35% reduction in useful gradient updates.
- **Run-to-run variance is ~12%** (student notes prior identical run got 124.29). This is significant for low-effect-size schedule comparisons but smaller than the gap to the provisional best (~7%).
- **Sent back** with: `warmup_epochs=1`, `T_max=13` (matches achievable horizon), keep `eta_min=5e-6`. This makes the floor actually engage and preserves nearly all useful gradient updates — a fair test of the hypothesis.

### Analysis & conclusions

- **+26% vs provisional best 133.9** — clearly a regression, but driven entirely by undertraining. Curve still in steep descent at e7 cap.
- **Capacity scaling has a wall-clock × architecture cost that this hypothesis underweighted.** 192/6/6/4 multiplies activation memory ~4× (mlp_ratio compounds with width and layers in the MLP intermediate). At 277 s/epoch, bs=3 only buys 7 epochs vs the baseline shape's 14.
- **bs=4 OOM at 92 GB during epoch 7** — fragmentation pushed it past the limit on a larger-mesh batch. No margin at this capacity.
- **Sent back** with a narrower bump: `n_hidden 128 → 160` (width-only, ~1.5× params, n_head=5 keeps head dim 32). Keep bs=4. Rebase for NaN-safe scoring. Goal: ≥18 epochs in 30 min and a finite test_avg.

```

### Analysis & conclusions

- **Essentially tied** with the provisional best (134.4 vs 133.9, +0.36% — well within noise).
- **Per-split signature is informative.** vs edward's confounded run, askeladd is **better on val_re_rand (116.3 vs 127.0) and val_geom_camber_cruise (98.8 vs 102.7)** and worse on val_single_in_dist. That is exactly where surface boosting should help — the OOD splits whose paper-facing test_avg is what matters.
- **Throughput-limited.** Last two epochs dropped val_avg from 184.6 → 140.8 → 134.4 — the trajectory was still in steep descent at the wall-clock cap. Strong evidence that the bs=4 run is undertrained.
- **VRAM heavily underutilized** (42 GB of 95 GB) — bs↑ is the obvious next move.
- **Sent back** with: keep surf_weight=25, raise bs to 8, rebase to pick up the NaN-safe scoring fix. Goal: 25+ epochs and finite test_avg.

### Analysis & conclusions

- 162.56 at epoch 10 is **+21%** vs. the provisional baseline (133.89) — but both are timeout-bound and frieren's run reached only epoch 10/11 vs. edward's 13/14, so the comparison is undertrained on both ends. Val curve was non-monotonic (e7→165.7, e8→171.5, e9→189.9, e10→162.6, e11→193.3), suggesting bs=4 + slice_num=128 has high gradient noise.
- **Critical underutilization.** Peak VRAM 54.5 GB of 95 GB available — frieren can roughly double bs without OOM, which would both reduce per-epoch wall clock and stabilize gradients.
- **Frieren independently rediscovered the `data/scoring.py` NaN bug** (already patched on advisor branch via PR #1095 review).
- **Sent back** with: keep slice_num=128, raise bs to 8 (or higher targeting 80%+ VRAM), add output pressure clamping to prevent fp32 overflow on cruise. Goal: 20+ epochs and finite test_avg.

### Analysis & conclusions

- 165.30 val_avg at epoch 7/50 is **+23%** vs. provisional baseline (133.89), but only 8 vs. 14 epochs — undertrained. Val_avg trajectory: e1→222 → e7→165 → e8→226 (oscillation suggests we're already near the noisy regime under bs=5 + this width).
- **Width is the wrong knob with this MLP shape.** mlp_ratio=2 + n_hidden=256 + ~242K nodes × bs=5 → 92 GB VRAM. The MLP intermediate dominates activation memory.
- **Test pressure overflow on cruise.** Cruise samples produce predictions large enough that squared error overflows fp32. This is independent of the cruise GT NaN — it's a model output stability issue.
- **Sent back** with: keep n_hidden=256, drop mlp_ratio 2 → 1 (halves MLP activation), bs=6 (fall back to 4 if OOM), add output pressure clamping. Goal: 20+ epochs and finite test_avg.

### Analysis & conclusions

- Run trained stably; val curve trended down monotonically (230.9 → 133.89 over 14 epochs).
- This is the first round-1 number on the board; with no prior baseline on this branch it provisionally sets the bar at **133.892** until other in-flight PRs return.
- **Confounded normalization.** The instructed formula divides by `ch_w.sum()=6`, softening aggregate surface signal by ~3× vs. the unweighted variant. The student correctly flagged this — the run is partially a "lower effective surf_weight" experiment, not a pure pressure-channel-boost. Sending PR back with corrected normalization (`/ ch_w.mean()` keeps aggregate surface contribution constant).
- **Critical bug found in `data/scoring.py`.** Mask-by-multiply propagates NaN through `(NaN × 0) = NaN`, producing NaN in `test_avg/mae_surf_p` whenever any test sample has non-finite y. One sample in `test_geom_camber_cruise` triggers it. Fix applied to advisor branch (`torch.where`-based masking).
- Still 14/50 epochs runs (timeout-bound). Suggests architectural/loss changes that don't slow the per-epoch wall clock will compound with the training-discipline experiments in flight.
